# slideshow
a (vertically scrolling) slideshow webapp using simple markdown

1) First create a text file called 'slideshow' in the same folder as this app. 
2) Follow these markdown instructions: 

The first item indicates what the row should be, delimited by an underscore<br />
S_ = the title of the slideshow<br />
**_ = A heading for some bulletpoints<br /> 
***_ = subheadings, bulleted by a '-'<br /> 
'-'_ = a break between one slide and another<br />
IMG_ = you can place an image in the slideshow at this point. Simply place the image in the same folder<br />
TXT_ = you can place the entire contents of a file (maybe some code in a .txt file for example) at this point and it will appear in the slideshow<br />
E_ = the end of the slideshow (it'll just say "Q&A")<br />

3) ensure you add any images/code to the folder the app is in then run the app<br />
Simple as that<br />
