# slideshow
a slideshow webapp using simple markdown

1) First create a text file called 'slideshow' in the same folder as this app.
2) Follow these markdown instructions:

The first item indicates what the row should be, delimited by an underscore.
S = the title of the slideshow
** = A heading for some bulletpoints
*** = subheadings, bulleted by a -
- = a break between one slide and another
IMG = you can place an image in the slideshow at this point. Simply place the image in the same folder.
CODE = you can place code, or the entire contents of a file, at this point and it will appear in the slideshow.
E_THE END = the end of the slideshow (it'll just say "Q&A")

3) ensure you add any images/code to the folder the app is in then run the app.
Simple as that.
