# slideshow
a (vertically scrolling) slideshow webapp using simple markdown

1) First create a text file called 'slideshow' in the same folder as this app. 
2) Follow these markdown instructions: 

The first item indicates what the row should be, delimited by an underscore<br />

S_ = the title of the slideshow<br />

*_ = A heading for some bulletpoints<br /> 

**_ = subheadings, bulleted by a '-'<br /> 

'-'_ = a break between one slide and another<br />

IMG_ = you can place an image in the slideshow within the current slide of choice. Simply place the image in the same folder<br />

TXT_ = you can place the entire contents of a file (maybe some code in a .txt file for example) at this point and it will appear in the slideshow for the current slide<br />

E_ = the end of the slideshow, maybe add 'Q&A' or 'Ending' etc<br />

3) ensure you add any images/code to the folder the app is in then run the app<br />
Simple as that<br />
