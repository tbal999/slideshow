# vslideshow
A (vertically scrolling) slideshow webapp using simple markdown language 

1) First create a text file called 'slideshow' in the same folder as this app. 
2) Follow these markdown instructions: 

The first item indicates what the row should be, delimited by an underscore<br />

<b>S_</b> = the title of the slideshow<br />

<b>*_</b> = A heading for some bulletpoints<br /> 

<b>**_</b> = subheadings, bulleted by a '-'<br /> 

<b>-_</b> = a break between one slide and another<br />

<b>IMG_</b> = you can place an image in the slideshow within the current slide of choice. Simply place the image in the same folder<br />

<b>TXT_</b> = you can place the entire contents of a file (maybe some code in a .txt file for example) at this point and it will appear in the slideshow for the current slide<br />

<b>E_</b> = the end of the slideshow, maybe add 'Q&A' or 'Ending' etc<br />

3) ensure you add any images/code to the folder the app is in then run the app<br />
Simple as that<br />
