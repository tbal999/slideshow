# slideshow
a slideshow webapp using simple markdown

1) First create a text file called 'slideshow' in the same folder as this app. 
2) Follow these markdown instructions: 

The first item indicates what the row should be, delimited by an underscore<br />
S = the title of the slideshow<br />
** = A heading for some bulletpoints<br /> 
*** = subheadings, bulleted by a '-'<br /> 
- = a break between one slide and another<br />
IMG = you can place an image in the slideshow at this point. Simply place the image in the same folder<br />
CODE = you can place code, or the entire contents of a file, at this point and it will appear in the slideshow<br />
E_THE END = the end of the slideshow (it'll just say "Q&A")<br />

3) ensure you add any images/code to the folder the app is in then run the app<br />
Simple as that<br />
