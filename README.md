# slideshow
a slideshow webapp using simple markdown

1) First create a text file called 'slideshow' in the same folder as this app. \
2) Follow these markdown instructions: \

The first item indicates what the row should be, delimited by an underscore.
S = the title of the slideshow\
** = A heading for some bulletpoints\
*** = subheadings, bulleted by a -\
- = a break between one slide and another\
IMG = you can place an image in the slideshow at this point. Simply place the image in the same folder.\
CODE = you can place code, or the entire contents of a file, at this point and it will appear in the slideshow.\
E_THE END = the end of the slideshow (it'll just say "Q&A")\

3) ensure you add any images/code to the folder the app is in then run the app.\
Simple as that.\
